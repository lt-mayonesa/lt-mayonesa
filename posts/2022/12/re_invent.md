Hey net, the other week I had the chance of attending #awsreinvent2022! Some friends asked me about it so I thought I would write something down:
 
tl;dr: If you haven't been, try to be there next year and see for yourself :) and go google ‚Äúinfrastructure FROM code‚Äù
 
I'll start by saying that it's really an amazing endeavor, over 50,000 people taking place in 7 different venues across Las Vegas, also re-play. Paying attention to the design of the whole thing, taking into account transportation, food, after parties, even just organizing the talks, it‚Äôs something on another level. For example, there were a lot of employees located in spots where you were probably going to get lost so you could ask for directions. Amazing.
 
Be prepared, they are gonna sell you AWS products and they are not gonna be subtle about it (although hardly anything is subtle in Vegas). And I get it, it's AWS's conference, but I still felt that it was a bit too much. Most of the sessions had the same voice:
- Hey do you know that situation X, well we have this AWS service for that. And do you remember that other situation? Here's AWS situation fixer.
And again, I get it, but personally I felt most of the times it lacked some technical justifications around the why: A) the service actually exists, and B) you should use it. So people (and I mean me) can actually improve their decision making. It also made attending some sessions a bit tedious, after the third in a day with the same rhythm you start to get sleepy.
All this made it look like there was this overwhelming hand of AWS session standardization: talk this way, do this, don‚Äôt forget to advertise the products, especially the new ones! And I feel it‚Äôs a shame because some speakers had really interesting things to say but they were unable to because the main subject is: sell.
 
Regardless, what‚Äôs something that popped in my radar?
Infrastructure FROM code! It‚Äôs basically this concept where you get rid of IaC and use your actual application code as the source of truth for your infrastructure, therefore allowing you to achieve some kind of adaptive infrastructure. There are already some tools around like ampt, encore, and others. 
 
I did love the Expo Hall, come forth precious networking. Given our distributed world it's really a great place to be able to chat with the companies (or people from said companies) from around the world that sometimes one feels they are out of our reach. I was able to get into amazing conversations with people from: #elastic , #mongodb , #gitlab , #thoughtworks üíö , and much more. There's also a lot of swag.
On a final note on networking, the meal spaces are really nice. You can meet a lot of interesting people, from very different backgrounds, most of whom are ready to jump into a technical debate around AWS and its many implementations which I really enjoyed.
 
Overall it was a great experience, and who knows, maybe I‚Äôll be there next year.
